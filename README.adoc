= Servlet to see number under transaction statistics

Simple servlet which uses datasource of default JBossEAP/Wildfly
configuration and start a transaction to get some number to statistics
for could be verified what is shown in that basic case.

. Create a war file and deploy to JBoss EAP/WildFly

* `mvn package`
* `cp target/transaction-metrics.war`

. Create management realm user to get access to management console

* `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/add-user.sh`

. Start JBoss EAP server

* `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml`

(there is used messaging as we need to have started `-full` profile)

. Enable statistics under transactions subsystem

* `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh -c --command="/subsystem=transactions:write-attribute(name=enable-statistics, value=true)"`
* `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh -c --command="reload"`

. Open webconsole at browser `localhost:9990` and go to
`Runtime > Standalone server > Subsystems > Transactions` and check by `Refresh Results`
what are the current statistics.

. Go to one of the links and see how statistics will change

* http://localhost:8080/transaction-metrics/commit
* http://localhost:8080/transaction-metrics/rollback
* http://localhost:8080/transaction-metrics/timeout
* http://localhost:8080/transaction-metrics/xacommitfail
